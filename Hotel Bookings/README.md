Data analysis is pretty cool, especially when it comes to hotel bookings. Have you ever thought about how much data hotels collect? It's a lot! But it's not just about collecting data, it's about using it to make better decisions. That's where creating a powerful database in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) comes in. With the right database, you can use SQL commands to explore the data and find hidden insights.

Once you've got the hang of writing SQL queries, it's time to ask the right questions to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA). For example, should the hotel increase the size of its parking lot? Are there any revenue trends that need to be addressed? By grouping data by hotel and creating a temporary table, you can find revenue trends and growth opportunities.

But data analysis isn't just about numbers and spreadsheets. It's also about visualizing the data with Power BI. Before importing the data into Power BI, you might need to preprocess some of the columns. But with a couple of left-join queries, you can combine the data and get it ready for visualization.

So, what kind of trends can you expect to see? Well, according to the data, revenue increased from 2018 to 2019 but then decreased in 2020. The average daily rate (ADR) increased from 2019 to 2020, but the total number of nights booked by customers decreased during the same period. However, the discount percentage offered by the hotel increased from 2019 to 2020, which helped to attract more customers.

Overall, hotel booking data analysis can be pretty exciting. By creating a solid database, conducting EDA, and visualizing the data with Power BI, you can find valuable insights that can help hotels make better decisions and grow their revenue. So, are you ready to embark on this adventure?

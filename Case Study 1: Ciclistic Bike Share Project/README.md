##Introduction 

Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, along with some key team members. To answer the business questions, follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. 

##Scenario 

I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve any recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
